# Tree
## We have 3 different Binary Trees which we will introduce and implement    
----------------------------------------------
- #### Full
- #### Perfect
- #### Complete    
       
**Full Tree** => If all the nodes have either 0 or 2 children     
    
**Perfect Tree** => If all the nodes have exactly 2 children    
     
**Complete Tree** => If you fill the tree from left to right with **NO** gap
